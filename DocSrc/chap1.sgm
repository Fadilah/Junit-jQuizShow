	<title>What is &jqs;</title>
	<para>
The &jqs; is based on the popular "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" TV
game show.  It forms the framework around which a group can play their own
Millionaire-like game, with one person acting as the host, one person in
the "hot seat," and with the remaining people forming the audience.
Three helplines (50/50, ask a friend, and poll the audience) are available
to the player.
	</para>
        <para>
The &jqs; is fully customizable. It is easy to add your own questions
and answers to the database (or use databases others have written),
change the music and sound effects, modify the prize levels, and more. It
includes network support to allow for a third-person to control the game
(thus freeing up the host), or for allowing multiple computers to display
the game screen simultaneously.
        </para>
        <para>
It is ideal for use in a classroom or church youth group setting, or at
the start of an meeting to break the ice.  Parents can even use
it as a fun way to test their kids (or for kids to test their
parents...).  Be creative!

	<title>System Requirements</title>
	<para>
&jqs; is written in 100% Pure Java<superscript>tm</superscript> 2
(v1.3) and, thus, can be run on any platform that supports Java
(Windows<superscript>tm</superscript>, Mac <superscript>tm</superscript>,
Linux, UNIX, etc.).
	</para>
	<para>
&jqs; requires that the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE)
version 1.3 or later be installed on your system in order to run.
A quick test can be performed to see if you have the JRE installed on your
system and to determine what version you have.  Execute the following
at your system's command prompt:
	<blockquote>
	    <para>
		<userinput>java -version</userinput>
	    </para>
	</blockquote>
If you have the JRE installed properly on your system, this command will
run and display the JRE version information.  If this command does not
work, you will need to install a version of the JRE on your system.
If the reported version of JRE is less than 1.3, you will need to
install a more recent version of the JRE on your system.

            <title>What is Java 2 and the JRE?</title>
	    <para>
Java 2 is a computer programming language that was first created by
the people at Sun Microsystems, Inc.  As with most programming languages,
the human readable Java source code must be changed into a binary form
before it can be executed by the computer.  This process is called 
compiling.  What sets the Java binary code ("Java bytecode") apart from
the binary code produced by most other computer languages is that
Java bytecodes are "platform-independent," that is it can theoretically
be run on any computer or other platform that supports Java (e.g.
a web browser).
	    </para>
	    <para>
What makes this all possible is the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM<superscript>tm</superscript>).
The JVM is a kind of translator that loads in the Java byte code and
does what it says.  The JVM is the key component of the Java 2 Runtime
Environment (JRE) and is required for running Java programs.
For computer systems, the JRE can either be included as part of
the operating system or it can be installed as a separate package
as needed.

            <title>Getting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</title>
	    <para>
Versions of the JRE are provided by Sun Microsystems, Inc. for the Windows,
Linux and Solaris platforms.  To download the latest version of the JRE
for these platforms, please visit the 
		<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/j2se">
		    <citetitle>Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition</citetitle>
		</ulink> web page, and click on the "Download Now" link.
            </para>
            <para>
For Mac users, Java is built into Mac OS X.  For more information regarding
this, please see the Apple Computer, Inc.

For most other platforms, a third-party port of Java is available.  For
information on the platforms on which a port of Java is available,

Note, however, that add-ons to &jqs; may or may not be released under the
same license.
	</para>
	<para>
An example is the <emphasis><literal>jQuizShowSounds.jar</literal></emphasis>
add-on.  Though it is completely free for use with the jQuizShow game, its
contents, specifically the sound loops included in it,
<emphasis>may not</emphasis> be repackaged nor
redistributed for other purposes; a special license was granted by the
author, Rob Kirkwood, for the distribution of his sound loops with the
jQuizShow.  The original MP3 sound loops and other music tracks which
Mr. Kirkwood has authored, however, can be acquired royalty-free
directly from his site

	<para>
The Java source code for the &jqs; is also available under the terms
of the GNU GPL.   If you are interested in the source code, please
visit the
