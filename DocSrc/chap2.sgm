	    <para>
After &jqs; is started, the main &jqs; screen should appear.
From the <guimenu>File</guimenu>, select the
<guimenuitem>New Player...</guimenuitem> option to begin a new round.
Two windows will appear on the screen.  The first is the current score
screen, and the second is a window asking if you are ready.
Press <keycap>SPACE</keycap> when you are ready to start.
The ready message will now be replaced with the primary game window.
The parts of the &jqs; game are labelled below.

	    </mediaobject>
	    <para>
The <guilabel>Score Screen</guilabel> displays the current accomplishment
(or prize) level that the player has reached.  The red bar marks the
current level being attempted.  The levels marked in white are the
key transition levels for the game.  When a player reaches one of these
levels, the player's earnings will not drop below that level; that is,
his winnings are guaranteed to be at least that amount if the player
misses a question.
	    </para>
	    <para>
The <guilabel>Game Screen</guilabel> is the primary focus of the game.
This screen shows the states of the current lifelines, the question
and all the possible answers.  It also displays the current question
timer which begins counting down after the last of the possible answer
is displayed.  This timer is simply a means to help keep the game
moving by limiting the amount of time a player can spend on any given
question.  This timer is optional and can be disabled from the Options
menu.
	    </para>
	    <para>
From this point, pressing the <keycap>SPACE</keycap> key will display the
first question.  Additional presses of the <keycap>SPACE</keycap> key
will display each of the possible answers to the question one-by-one
until all the possible answers are displayed.

		    <imagedata fileref="answer_shown.png" format="PNG">
		</imageobject>
	    </mediaobject>
	    <para>
After all the answers have been displayed, the question timer will start.
The player at this point is asked to choose one of the answers.  The player's
choice is selected by either using the mouse to select one of the answers,
or by using the keyboard to enter the character associated with the
answer (A, B, C or D in this example).  This will highlight the answer in
orange.
	    </para>

		<imageobject>
		    <imagedata fileref="answer_selected.png" format="PNG">
		</imageobject>
	    </mediaobject>
	    <para>
After selecting an answer, the player is still allowed to change their
selection or to choose a lifeline.  However, at some point, the player
will have to indicate that the choice is their final answer, whether by
saying so or by answering yes to the host's question as to whether it
is the player's final answer.
            </para>
            <para>
To finalize the answer, press the <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.  An appropriate
sound effect will be played to acknowledge this event.  At this point, the
chosen answer cannot be changed nor a lifeline selected.  Pressing
<keycap>SPACE</keycap> will reveal the correct answer to the question.
If the selected answer was correct, the orange highlight will change to
green and a sound effect will be played.

	    </mediaobject>
            <para>
Pressing <keycap>SPACE</keycap> once more will cause &jqs; to display the
transition screen.  This screen displays the current level achieved
by the player.
            </para>
	    <mediaobject>
		<imageobject>
		    <imagedata fileref="transition_screen.png" format="PNG">
		</imageobject>
	    </mediaobject>
	    <para>
On the other hand, if the answer was incorrect, the wrong answer sound
effect will be played and the correct answer will be highlighted in green.
	    </para>
	    <mediaobject>

		    <imagedata fileref="answer_wrong.png" format="PNG">

	    </mediaobject>
	    <para>
The game is over at this point.  The player's final earnings will be
displayed.  The final earnings after a wrong answer is given is determined
by the last key transition level reached by the player (white levels on
the Score Screen).  If the player had not reached a key transition level,
the player will win nothing.
	    </para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
	    <title>Helplines</title>
	    <para>
There are three helplines available for the player to use during the game.
Helplines are options that the player can choose to help the player choose
the correct answer.
            </para>
            <para>
The helplines are:
	        <itemizedlist>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
Fifty-fifty
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
Ask-a-Friend
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
Poll the Audience
			</para>
		    </listitem>
	        </itemizedlist>
	    </para>
	    <para>
Each helpline can only be used once during the game.  Once it is used, it is
eliminated from the available list of helplines; this is indicated by a
red "X" over its icon.  A player may choose to use more than one helpline
during a round if desired.
            </para>
            <para>
A helpline can be selected by either using the hotkey associated with the
helpline or by selecting the helpline with the mouse.  Helplines can
only be selected after all the possible answers have been displayed, and
prior to finalizing a chosen answer.  The
<keycode>ENTER</keycode> is used to confirm and activate the helpline.
Select an answer or a different helpline or press
<keycode>BACKSPACE</keycode> to cancel the current selection.
            </para>
            <para>
Each of the helplines are described in the following sections.
            </para>
	    <sect3>
	        <title>Fifty-fifty helpline</title>
		<para>
Fifty-fifty is the only helpline that does not involve audience participation.
It works by randomly eliminating two of the three wrong answers, leaving
only one wrong answer and the correct answer.  This gives the player
a fifty-fifty chance at guessing the right answer.  The next two figures
show snapshots of the before and after effects of using the fifty-fifty
helpline.

	        <title>Ask-a-Friend helpline</title>
		<para>
The idea behind the Ask-a-Friend helpline was for the player to choose
one person from a list of pre-chosen friends to advise the player
regarding the answer to the question.  The interaction between the
player and the friend is timed (default is 30 seconds).  When the
time limit has elapsed, no further communication with the friend
(or anyone else in the audience for that matter) is allowed.
		</para>
		<para>
This helpline was implemented with a large game timer which counts down
the time remaining.  The <keycode>SPACE</keycode> key is used to
start and pause the timer.  Press <keycode>RETURN</keycode> to close
the timer and resume the game play.
		</para>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3>
	        <title>Poll the Audience helpline</title>
		<para>
How to handle the Poll the Audience helpline is up to the host.  Ideas
include:
		    <itemizedlist>
		        <listitem>
			  <para>
The audience raise their hands (or yells) to vote for the correct answer
as the host reads through each answer.
			  </para>
			</listitem>
		        <listitem>
			  <para>
The audience gets up and moves to forms groups around the room based on
what they think the correct answer is.

			</listitem>

Or, [put your idea here]
			  </para>
		        </listitem>
		    </itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
The Poll the Audience option simply plays a music loop when the helpline
is activated.  To end the Poll the Audience phase and return game play,
press <keycode>SPACE</keycode>.

when playing the game.

The SPACE BAR is the most used key.  If in doubt what to do, press it to
move to the next game state (e.g. to display each possible answer
one-by-one, to move from the transition screen to the next round,
start/stop the Call-a-Friend timer, etc.).
	    </para>
	    <para>
In addition, the number keys (0-9) can be configured to play custom
sound samples.

	    <title>Mouse Controls</title>
	    <para>
    In the current version of &jqs;, the mouse does not play a very large role
    when the game is actually being played; the keyboard controls are the primary
    controls during a game.  The mouse can be used in the following ways on
    the game screen itself:
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
    Selection of an answer
		    </para>

		<listitem>
		    <para>
    Selection of a helpline
		    </para>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <para>
    In addition, the mouse can be used to interact with the &jqs; windows as
    normal (e.g. move or resize a window, close it, select a menu option, etc.).
