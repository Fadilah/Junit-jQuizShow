	<title>Question Database File</title>
	<para>
The &jqs; requires a Question Database File (QDF) in order to play.  It
is probably the most important input file for the game.
        </para>
	<para>
The QDF used for the game is specified either by using the
<guimenuitem>Load new questions...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>File</guimenu> menu, or by specifying the path to the file
with the <literal>questionFile</literal> property in the
<filename>config.ini</filename> file.  The latter will result in the
specified QDF being loaded as the default question database.
	</para>
	<sect2>
	    <title>Contents</title>
	    <para>
The QDF is used to specify the following:
	    </para>
	    <variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
		    <term>Difficulty level</term>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
In a typical &jqs; game, the difficulty of the questions increases as
the player successfully answer each questions.  Each question in the
database must be assigned a difficulty level.  The level is represented
by a number from 0 (easiest) to <literal>numDifficultyBreakpoints</literal>
(as specified in the <filename>config.ini</filename> file).  Thus, there
are <literal>numDifficultyBreakpoints + 1</literal> difficulty levels.
			</para>
			<para>
Levels should be assigned after careful evaluation of the target audience,
taking into account age, education, background, and other factors.
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		    <term>Question</term>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
The question worded exactly as it is to appear in the game.  There is
no effective limit on the number of characters (the font will scale so that
the text will fit in the question box), but for readibility it should not
exceed two lines on the screen.  The best way to determine how it would
look is to try it.  It will be different depending on the size of the
display screen.
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		    <term>Answers</term>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
The first answer listed <emphasis>must</emphasis> be the correct answer.
The following answers are each of the incorrect answer choices.
The &jqs; will display the list of possible answers in a random order
on the game screen.  The answers should be as short as possible for readability.
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		    <term>Note</term>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
An optional note can be included as the last entry on a line.
This note is preceded by a pound sign (<keycap>#</keycap>) to differentiate
it from an answer entry.  This note will be displayed under the answer
boxes when the correct answer is revealed.
			</para>

	    <title>File format</title>
	    <para>
The file is an ASCII-based (i.e. text-based) table.
Each row of the table contains a question and its associated data.
The separator for each column of a row is a <keycap>Tab</keycap>
character.  This type of text file is sometimes referred to as a
file containing "tab-separated values".
	    </para>
	    <para>
The columns are ordered as follows:
	    </para>
	    <blockquote>
	        <para>
		    <literal>
difficulty_level  question  answer1  answer2  [...]  [#note]
		    </literal>
		</para>
	    </blockquote>
	    <para>
If a pound sign (<keycap>#</keycap>) appears as the first character in
the first column, the row will be ignored.  This can be used to
comment out a row.
	    </para>
	    <para>
Column entries containing spaces (e.g. questions) do not need to be
quoted.  However, double quotes can be used to enclose these entries
(as generated by some tools) if desired.  Due to this allowance, if a
double qoute literal is to appear within the column, the double quote
must be doubled (e.g. <keycap>""</keycap>).  See the example below.

	<title>Config.ini File</title>
	<para>
The &jqs; configuration file (<filename>config.ini</filename>) is used for
customizing the game.  If a <filename>config.ini</filename> file is not
provided, the default configuration that was built into the &jqs; will
be used.
        </para>
	<para>
The user-supplied configuration file must be located in the
release directory of the &jqs; program and have the filename
<filename>config.ini</filename>.
	</para>
	<sect2>
	    <title>File format</title>
	    <para>
The file is an ASCII (text-based) file.  Each configuration parameter
is specified using a keyword-value pair.  The format of each pair is:
	    </para>
	    <blockquote>
	        <para>
		    <literal>
keyword = value
		    </literal>
		</para>
	    </blockquote>
	    <para>
If a pound sign (<keycap>#</keycap>) appears as the first character in
the first column, the row will be ignored.  This can be used to
comment out a row.  Blank lines are also ignored.
