Playing the game:
=================

    jQuizShow was designed to work in a group environment, with a "hot
    seat", game host, audience and simulated "call-a-friend".  Thus, the
    controls are centered around either the game host selecting and
    controlling the game play or a 3rd party.

    Select "New Player..." from the File menu to start a game.

    The primary keys are:

        SPACE BAR         -- Move from one state to another
        ENTER KEY         -- Finalize the answer or use helpline
        letter keys       -- Select an answer

        , (comma)         -- Select 50/50 helpline
        . (period)        -- Select Call-a-Friend helpline
        / (slash)         -- Select Ask-the-Audience helpline
        ENTER KEY           -- End Call-a-Friend helpline mode

        BACKSPACE KEY     -- Cancels helpline selection or finalized
	                     answer

        = (equals)        -- Walk away from game with current earnings

        ~ (tilde)         -- Toggle score screen on/off

    The SPACE BAR is the most used key.  If in doubt what to do, press it to
    move to the next game state (e.g. to display each possible answer
    one-by-one, to move from the transition screen to the next round,
    start/stop the Call-a-Friend timer, etc.).

    In addition, the number keys (0-9) can be configured to play custom
    sound samples.

    NOTE:  If for some reason the keys do not appear to work, try using
    the mouse to select the "Game Screen" to make it the active window
    (highlighted border).
